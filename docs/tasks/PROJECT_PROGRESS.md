- Implemented `src/components/FundingFooter.astro` with finalized funding note text.
- Updated PL content across pages (`/pl/index`, `/pl/project`, `/pl/downloads`, `/pl/updates`, `/pl/bio`) with Polish diacritics.
- Reworked `/pl/project#research`: poster summary, ADC 2025 metadata, poster/docx links, poster preview.
- Reworked `/pl/bio` using context materials: profile photo, biogram, selected publications, conferences, portfolio and CV links.
- Added supporting styles for funding footer alignment, poster card, and bio layout.
- Reworked `/pl/bio` publications section into separated article cards with dedicated links under each item.
- Added interactive timeline (expand/collapse) for “Wybrane wystąpienia i aktywności” in `/pl/bio`.
- Added AES article direct link in publications:
  - `https://aes.org/publications/elibrary-page/?id=22884`
- Updated publication link labels: DOI entries now display clickable DOI numbers instead of the generic label.
- Replaced bio activity list with a horizontal interactive timeline (rail + active detail card).
- Removed visible top/bottom gradient strips by simplifying global background and removing edge-revealing margins.
- Timeline refinement: years are now anchored to the axis with subtle vertical separators at the start of each year group.
- Timeline separators are visual-only (short, low-contrast), keeping card readability and preserving mobile horizontal scrolling.
- Updated `/pl/bio`: short intro on top + full note section at the bottom with clearer paragraph spacing and highlighted links.
- Updated full bio note so the KPO project link is embedded directly in the project title.
- Removed public portfolio/CV exposure:
  - removed buttons from `/pl/bio`
  - removed `public/assets/bio/portfolio-grzegorz-samson-pl.pdf`
  - removed `public/assets/bio/grzegorz-samson-cv-en-2025.pdf`
- Navigation update (PL): replaced `Pobieranie` with `Wtyczka VST` and added new tabs:
  - `Nauka`
  - `Warsztaty`
  - `Stypendium`
- Reworked `/pl/downloads` into a full `Wtyczka VST` page with plugin functionality, use-cases, and panel descriptions.
- Added public plugin panel assets:
  - `public/assets/plugin/controls-panel.png`
  - `public/assets/plugin/multichannel-panel.png`
  - `public/assets/plugin/audio-generator-panel.png`
- Added new science page with ADC 2025 materials:
  - `src/pages/pl/science.astro`
- Added new workshops page based on workshop context:
  - `src/pages/pl/workshops.astro`
  - `public/assets/workshops/warsztaty-27-02-2026-gs.png`

  - `src/pages/pl/scholarship.astro`
  - `public/assets/certificates/certyfikat-kurs-1-matlab.pdf`
  - `public/assets/certificates/certyfikat-kurs-2-dataiku.pdf`
  - `public/assets/certificates/certyfikat-kurs-3-aws.pdf`
- Updated scholarship milestone labels to `zrealizowane` and set all milestone statuses to `done`.
